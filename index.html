				<p id="chooseText" class="grey-text text-darken-2">This is a process book describing our final design and my role in the process of creating it. Our design problem was based on the theme surviving college. The problem we decided to take on was that University of Washington students don’t have an easy way to find event in the surrounding Seattle neighborhoods when they are outside their on-campus communities because they lack awareness of when, where, and what events are going on around them. Though this eventually became the problem statement we designed our solution around, the journey finding a problem that students actually face and creating something that would address that problem was long and arduous. We made many mistakes along the way, but eventually were able to create Pinpoint, a design solution that we’re proud of and solves our identified problem.</p>

				<p id="chooseText" class="grey-text text-darken-2">It was a crisp autumn day in early October when I met my teammates Natasha and Julian. We were randomly placed together into Group Two, and shortly after meeting one another began brainstorming possible problems with each other. A couple ideas were initially proposed. One was about connecting students to scholarships, another about selecting a major, a third about finding what college to attend, but none of these felt right. It wasn’t until I began talking about the frustrating process of trying to find on-campus events and clubs to attend that we found our problem. We all had, at one point or another, tried to get involved with some type of on-campus organization and found the process toilsome. With a problem in hand we excitedly started talking about possible solutions, and realized that we’d probably end up creating a website that helped students connect to RSOs and other on-campus events.</p>

				<p id="chooseText" class="grey-text text-darken-2">With this preliminary design problem in hand we started our interview process. Each of us interviewed three of our classmates, for a total of nine interviews. Every interview gave us new insight into our design problem. We found that many upperclassmen students were content with their on-campus involvement and didn’t often look to get more involved in new clubs or on-campus events. This was really surprising to our group and made us rethink our initial problem. We came together during one of our many group meetings and tried to decide whether our problem was actually a problem. We concluded that maybe it wasn’t, and went back to the drawing board. This was our first pivot point. We changed from on-campus events to off-campus events. This was inspired by a personal anecdote that Julian shared with us about his own struggle with finding open mic nights near UW. During this meeting I also asked if we should restrict our target demographic as well. I thought that since we were changing to off-campus events, we should focus solely on upperclassmen. These older students, like many of the students we interviewed, would be comfortable with on-campus resources, and be looking to expand their interests off-campus. Also upperclassmen are usually around 21 or 22 years old and will be looking to explore the nightlife outside of UW. </p>

				<p id="chooseText" class="grey-text text-darken-2">Once we had agreed upon this new, and exciting problem we began the process of ideating through possible solutions. During one of our class sessions we came up with forty possible solutions together as a group. Many of these solutions weren’t applicable or sensible in the slightest, but some of them had potential. After ideating together, we separately came up with forty ideas each on our own. Then we brought all these ideas together through convergent thinking in order to select our top three. I had previously showed Natasha and Julian Meetup.com, a website that helps you meet people in your local community who share your interests. This website stood out in our mind as an example of what our solution should be. I believe this slightly biased our ideation and choosing process. We ended up choosing a website solution that was very similar to Meetup.com called Eventfill, a calendar website that allows the user to impose their schedule over their friend’s schedules to find possible events, and One Event Away, a play on One Bus Away that similarly allowed the user to hop on a bus and as they traveled through the city see events happening around them.</p>

				<p id="chooseText" class="grey-text text-darken-2">After selecting our top three contenders each of us created a low fidelity prototype of one of the solutions. I created the prototype for Eventfill, Julian created one for the event calendar website, and Natasha took One Event Away. We began sketching, and adding features that we thought each of our solutions had to have. Even though we were all creating prototypes, we felt pretty sure that Eventfill would be the ultimate winner. When we had created our second problem statement we already had an inkling of what solution we wanted to create to solve a problem we didn’t even think of yet. This bias stuck with us throughout the prototyping process, but once these prototypes were completed we conducted another round of interviews.</p>

It was during this round that our bias towards Eventfill was ripped to shreds, and we saw the value in One Event Away. I went into my interviews assuming that my interviewees would want a simple, organized website that directly solved their problem, but what we found was that our interviewees wanted more. They wanted spontaneity and excitement. They wanted a solution that allowed them to find new events to go to, but was completely different from all the existing solutions. They wanted One Event Away.</p>

			<div class="container">
				<p id="chooseText" class="grey-text text-darken-2">After these interviews it was clear that we had to pursue One Event Away. Though there was some reserve at first, I insisted that our team follow the data collected through our interviews. We tasked Natasha with making the next round of prototypes as we began refining our design. We conducted a third round of interviews to get more potential user feedback on the specifics of our design. We changed many aspects of our application during this process, starting with our name and logo. Natasha came up with Pinpoint, which Julian and I agreed was the perfect name. I made the logo and decided that our main colors would be white, black, and a medium blue. With this new logo and color scheme we began our high fidelity prototype.  As the prototype became more sophisticated I began the daunting task questioning each design choice. For each design decision, from color, to font, to the order of the screens, I would call into question why we decided to implement it in that fashion. I remember having a debate with Julian and Natasha about the use of upper and lowercase lettering throughout our application. This conversation spiraled into a discussion of how “casual” our application was going to be. This is just one example, but many of our design choices came from debate, weighing the pros and cons, and deciding if it was something that the user would actually value in our application. If there wasn’t a good reason then I would either get rid of that feature or redesign it with our target user in mind to give purpose to every aspect of our design. I wrote our the lengthy reasoning for each and every decision and worked with Julian, who took on a lot of the graphic design, to create a seamless, uniform, clean, and purposeful prototype. We then tested our design against the ten design heuristics that we learned in class, but because of the extensive work my team and I had been putting in to ensure each choice benefited the user, we had very few errors to fix. </p>

						<p>We utilized whiteboards in a lot of our ideation process.

It wasn’t until we began articulating our problem statement that we began realizing that we were far from finished. Because we had decided early on that our solution would include some sort of website, we had put the cart before the horse so to speak. In our case, we had created a solution and then were desperately trying to fit our problem to our solution. I clearly remember sitting down with my teammates and saying that our problem and solution don’t fully match. Our app was all about spontaneity and finding fun things to do, but our problem was about building an off-campus community. Our solution didn’t solve our proposed problem at all. We had to go back to the beginning and look at what inspired us to make the change in problem statements, and then why our interviewees had chosen One Event Away. We realized that we had created a prototype independent of our initial problem, and now needed to infer what problem our solution was solving. After many hours spent scribbling on whiteboards trying to word our problem statement just right we came up with: University of Washington students don’t have an easy way to find events in the surrounding Seattle neighborhoods when they are outside their on-campus communities because they lack awareness of when, where, and what events are going on around them. Though we realize that this isn’t the traditional way of completing a design solution, we believe that this problem does still relate to surviving college and is something that many students face. </p>

Through the process of having to tailor our problem to match our solution I learned the value of finding a real problem and creating prototypes that directly solve that problem. I was extremely lucky to be grouped with Natasha and Julian. I can’t imagine how much harder this quarter would have been without them by my side to constantly support me. As a team we were able to create a solution based upon real user research that addressed a problem that students face. I am extremely proud of everything we’ve accomplished and I was able to play in the creation of Pinpoint.</p>
